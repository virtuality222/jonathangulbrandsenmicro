			 <p>Departure! 😀
We got out of bed this morning at 4am, picked up our friends and left for real at 5am.
We left with 100% battery, first stop was after two and a half hours and we charged for 20 mins (32-76%) at a 150kwh Supercharger.
Cold for July, 11-15 degrees, efficiency at 71%.</p>

			 <p>I’m so very very very happy and humbled that this happened today - 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. In Sweden for my age group, this was basically as early as has been possible.

<p>I hug their family members and I tell them the best way to honor their loved one is to go get vaccinated and encourage everyone they know to do the same. They cry. And they tell me they didn’t know. They thought it was a hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn’t get as sick. They thought it was ‘just the flu’. But they were wrong. And they wish they could go back. But they can’t. So they thank me and they go get the vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a small prayer that this loss will save more lives.”</p>

<p>(The car is standing still at the road by the way, there was no traffic. Also: apologies for the very dirty windshield, northern Sweden is insect-packed, I didn&rsquo;t want to stand still too long so didn&rsquo;t put the camera outside the car to take the photo)</p>

			 <p>Started packing today for summer vacation which I leave for on Thursday. Yes it’s early but I have an incredibly busy week the next few days. Felt good to reduce the “vacation prep stress”. Otherwise I’m very excited to go. Staying in Sweden this year as well which I have no issues at all with. Looking forward to it. Also bought a probably unnecessarily fancy gadget to water our plants when we’re gone. Might write a short review of it once I set it up later this week.
Also on vacation prep list: make a final book reading list! Suggestions accepted.</p>
<p>(Screenshot is the packing list generator app Packr I’ve used for last couple of years. I like it! Not linking to it to avoid anyone thinking I do affiliate links or something)</p>

			 <p>Selling my first product on eBay ever today. A camera lens that I am replacing with a different version. I am pretty nervous that I&rsquo;ve misconfigured things. eBay was not easy to sell on for the first time, had to put a much lower price than I was comfortable with as starting price due to &ldquo;seller limits&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>George Packer, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/how-donald-rumsfeld-deserves-be-remembered/619334/">in the Atlantic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rumsfeld was the worst secretary of defense in American history. Being newly dead shouldn’t spare him this distinction. He was worse than the closest contender, Robert McNamara, and that is not a competition to judge lightly. McNamara’s folly was that of a whole generation of Cold Warriors who believed that Indochina was a vital front in the struggle against communism. His growing realization that the Vietnam War was an unwinnable waste made him more insightful than some of his peers; his decision to keep this realization from the American public made him an unforgivable coward. But Rumsfeld was the chief advocate of every disaster in the years after September 11. Wherever the United States government contemplated a wrong turn, Rumsfeld was there first with his hard smile — squinting, mocking the cautious, shoving his country deeper into a hole. His fatal judgment was equaled only by his absolute self-assurance. He lacked the courage to doubt himself. He lacked the wisdom to change his mind.</p>

			 <p>My first ever Amazon product, and the first traditional e-reader I ever bought. I don&rsquo;t like the company, but I made extensive research and here in Sweden, it&rsquo;s just the best in terms of getting any content on there. Plus it was discounted to $90. Just had it for two days but love the experience so far.  I also love my iPad Pro 12.9&quot;, but this is very different. I have read way too few books over the last&hellip;. well lets be honest, 10 years. And I read like one book a day when I was 7 to 15 years old. Not sure what happened. But this is an attempt to get some of that back.</p>

			 <p>Today I very happily signed the Try Giving pledge of giving at least 2% of my income for the rest of my life to organizations that can use it most effectively to improve the lives of others. I did this via <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">Giving What We Can</a>. I was already donating to GiveWell but this meant doubling my monthly donations. I&rsquo;ll write more on what my choices were over the next few days.</p>
